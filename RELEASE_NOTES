ipmiComm-R1-3-0:  Use "initialized" flag to reflect whether our saved system 
                  configuration matches the actual configuration. If we detect that 
                  the system has just come back online, check hw configuration.
                  If there have been any changes, set flag to "not initialized". 
                  Misc other changes; see Changelog.
